    * Mission leader select players to go on mission
    * Whole group votes whether to go on this mission
    * If passes, begin mission
    * If rejected, mission leader switches to next player. If rejected 5x, bad wins
    * Mission: players in mission vote "Succeed" or "Fail" anomonously. If all votes are succeed, good gets a point. Otherwise, bad gets a point.
  * End game
    * Team with most points wins
    * Bad has redemption and can guess who merlin was to win the game (make the decider whichever bad was closest to last mission leader?)
